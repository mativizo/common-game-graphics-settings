## Anti-Aliasing (AA)
- **Why?** Anti-aliasing reduces jagged edges (aliasing) on objects and textures.
- **Options**: Common choices include FXAA, MSAA, TAA and off.
- **Impact**: Higher AA settings improve visual quality but may reduce performance.

## Texture Quality
- **Why?** Determines the resolution and detail of textures.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, Ultra (can also be: Quarter, Half, Full).
- **Impact**: Higher texture quality enhances visuals but requires more VRAM.

## Texture Filtering
- **Why?** Enhances texture clarity at oblique angles.
- **Options**: Anisotropic Filtering (AF) levels (e.g., 2x, 4x, 16x).
- **Impact**: Higher AF improves texture sharpness but slightly affects performance.

## Shadow Quality
- **Why?** Controls the detail and smoothness of shadows.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, Ultra.
- **Impact**: Higher shadow quality provides realistic shadows but can be demanding.
