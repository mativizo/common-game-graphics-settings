Let's go!

## Anti-Aliasing (AA)
- **Why?** Anti-aliasing reduces jagged edges (aliasing) on objects and textures.
- **Options**: Common choices include FXAA, MSAA, TAA and off.
- **Impact**: Higher AA settings improve visual quality but may reduce performance.



## Texture Quality
- **Why?** Determines the resolution and detail of textures.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, Ultra (can also be: Quarter, Half, Full).
- **Impact**: Higher texture quality enhances visuals but requires more VRAM.

## Texture Filtering
- **Why?** Enhances texture clarity at oblique angles.
- **Options**: Anisotropic Filtering (AF) levels (e.g., 2x, 4x, 16x).
- **Impact**: Higher AF improves texture sharpness but slightly affects performance.

## Shadow Quality
- **Why?** Controls the detail and smoothness of shadows.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, Ultra.
- **Impact**: Higher shadow quality provides realistic shadows but can be demanding.

## Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
- **Why?** Simulates ambient lighting occlusion in real-time.
- **Options**: On and off.
- **Impact**: SSAO adds depth and realism but may impact performance1.

## Bloom
- **Why?** Creates a soft, glowing effect around bright objects.
- **Options**: On and off or bloom levels.
- **Impact**: Bloom enhances visual appeal but can be toned down for performance.

## Refraction
- **Why?** Handles light bending through transparent materials.
- **Options**: On and off.
- **Impact**: Refraction adds realism but may require additional GPU power.

- [V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization)](#v-sync-vertical-synchronization)

## V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization)
- **Why?** Synchronizes the frame rate of the game with the refresh rate of the monitor.
- **Options**: On/Off.
- **Impact**: Enabling V-Sync prevents screen tearing but may introduce input lag.

## Resolution
- **Why?** Determines the display resolution of the game.
- **Options**: Common resolutions include 1920x1080 (Full HD), 2560x1440 (Quad HD), and 3840x2160 (4K).
- **Impact**: Higher resolutions provide sharper visuals but require more GPU power.

## Window Mode
- **Why?** Defines how the game window appears on the screen.
- **Options**: Fullscreen - The game occupies the entire screen. Windowed - The game runs in a resizable window. Borderless Window - Similar to windowed mode but without borders.
- **Impact**: Fullscreen offers better performance, while windowed modes allow multitasking.

## Frame Rate Limit
- **Why?** Caps the maximum frame rate to a specific value.
- **Options**: Customizable (e.g., 30 FPS, 60 FPS, 120 FPS).
- **Impact**: Limiting the frame rate can reduce GPU load and prevent overheating.

## Depth of Field (DoF)
- **Why?** Simulates camera focus effects.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, or Off.
- **Impact**: Higher DoF adds realism but may affect performance.

## Motion Blur
- **Why?** Creates a blur effect during fast camera movements.
- **Options**: On/Off.
- **Impact**: Motion blur enhances cinematic feel but can be disabled for competitive games.

## Anisotropic Filtering (AF)
- **Why?** Improves texture clarity at oblique angles.
- **Options**: Levels (e.g., 2x, 4x, 16x).
- **Impact**: Higher AF settings enhance texture sharpness.
