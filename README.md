Let's go!

## Anti-Aliasing (AA)
- **Why?** Anti-aliasing reduces jagged edges (aliasing) on objects and textures.
- **Options**: Common choices include FXAA, MSAA, TAA and off.
- **Impact**: Higher AA settings improve visual quality but may reduce performance.



## Texture Quality
- **Why?** Determines the resolution and detail of textures.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, Ultra (can also be: Quarter, Half, Full).
- **Impact**: Higher texture quality enhances visuals but requires more VRAM.

## Texture Filtering
- **Why?** Enhances texture clarity at oblique angles.
- **Options**: Anisotropic Filtering (AF) levels (e.g., 2x, 4x, 16x).
- **Impact**: Higher AF improves texture sharpness but slightly affects performance.

## Shadow Quality
- **Why?** Controls the detail and smoothness of shadows.
- **Options**: Low, Medium, High, Ultra.
- **Impact**: Higher shadow quality provides realistic shadows but can be demanding.

## Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
- **Why?** Simulates ambient lighting occlusion in real-time.
- **Options**: On and off.
- **Impact**: SSAO adds depth and realism but may impact performance1.

## Bloom
- **Why?** Creates a soft, glowing effect around bright objects.
- **Options**: On and off or bloom levels.
- **Impact**: Bloom enhances visual appeal but can be toned down for performance.

## Refraction
- **Why?** Handles light bending through transparent materials.
- **Options**: On and off.
- **Impact**: Refraction adds realism but may require additional GPU power.
